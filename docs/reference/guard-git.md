# guard-git

Holds `git push`, `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` until you reply in chat, and refuses a bare force push, a commit on `main` and `git add -A`.

| | |
|---|---|
| Kind | Hook — runs by itself; it cannot ask, only pass, refuse, or print |
| Runs on Claude Code | `PreToolUse`, matcher `Bash\|PowerShell` |
| Runs on Antigravity | `PreToolUse`, matcher `run_command` |
| Script | `scripts/guard_git.py` |
| Self-check | `scripts/test_guard_git.py` |

## What it does

It reads each shell command before it runs and ends in one of three ways: pass, `REFUSED:` or `HELD:`. The word opens the message the session reads.

- **A refusal has no reply that lets it through.** The session fixes the command itself.
- **A hold waits for your reply in chat.** The session ends its turn on the exact command and the commits it publishes, then runs it only on a clear yes. The full stop is in [Gates](../concepts/gates.md).
- **Quoted text is data.** A commit message or a heredoc body that mentions `gh pr create` or `git push --force` is not a call.
- **Options before the subcommand do not shake it off.** `git -c k=v push`, `git -C dir commit` and `git --no-pager push` are read like the bare spelling.

The rule behind it is the `GIT` block of the norms; see [session-start](session-start.md).

## What it refuses or holds

| Case | What happens | What lets it through |
|---|---|---|
| `git add` with `-A`, `--all`, `.` or `./` anywhere among its arguments — `git add src -A` and `git add -- .` included | `REFUSED: git add -A / git add . is not used in this repo.` | Naming the paths: `git add src/app/orders/page.tsx` |
| `git push` with `--force`, `-f` or a `+` refspec such as `+main` among its own arguments, a continued line included | `REFUSED: a bare force push.` | `--force-with-lease`, which is held like any push |
| `git commit` while HEAD is on `main`, in a repo that has a `development` branch, local or on `origin` | `REFUSED: HEAD is on main.` | Switching to `development` first |
| `git push`, `--force-with-lease` included | `HELD: a push runs only on the user's yes in chat.` | Your reply |
| `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge` | `HELD: opening or merging a pull request runs only on the user's yes in chat.` | Your reply |

A held command passes only when all four hold, read from the conversation's transcript:

1. The session's last message before your reply puts the exact command on a line of its own in backticks, or alone in a fenced block. A multi-line command can only go in a fence.
2. You typed a reply to that message, with text in it.
3. Nothing else was typed after it.
4. The command has not already run on that reply.

How the four are read:

- **The command must match.** Whitespace is collapsed, nothing else. Another branch is another command and needs its own message and reply.
- **One reply, one run.** A call of the command in either shell spends the reply once its result is in the transcript. Another message and reply grant one more run. A held attempt made before your reply spends nothing.
- **Things you did not type are ignored.** A tool result, a subagent's prompt or a note written by the host neither grants nor takes a reply back. On Antigravity only a step the user typed counts.
- **A dialog pick is no reply.** `Run` picked on a question dialog does not count.
- **A transcript that cannot be read holds the command.**

## What it lets through

- **Everyday git and gh.** `git add` with named paths, `git commit -m '...' -- <path>`, `git status`, `git fetch`, `gh pr view`, `gh release list`.
- **A commit on `main` in a repo with no `development` branch.** Refusing there would leave the session nowhere to commit.
- **A `+` inside a branch name.** `git push origin feature+search` is held, not refused as a force.
- **A flag that belongs to a later command.** `git push origin dev && rm -f x` is held as a push, not refused as a force.
- **Paths that only open like `.`.** `.gitignore` and `./src/a.ts` are named paths.
- **Commands with no `git` or `gh` in them,** such as `npm run dev`.

## What it does not reach

- **A command inside quotes.** `sh -c 'git push'` hides from it, because quoted text is blanked before any rule reads the command.
- **The meaning of your reply.** It proves the stop happened and that you replied; the session reads the words. See [Gates](../concepts/gates.md).
- **Who typed a reply is inferred on Claude Code.** Every user entry that is not a tool result, a subagent prompt or a host note is taken as typed by you. A prompt a host writes on its own would read as yours.
- **On Antigravity a result is paired to its call by position,** which holds while a step carries one call.
- **Only the shell tools are read.** The hook is wired to `Bash` and `PowerShell` on Claude Code and to `run_command` on Antigravity.
