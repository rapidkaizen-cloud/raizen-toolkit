# The pass — Step 7: every page, across sessions where it must

**The approved canvas is the specification.** Drawn elements land as drawn; undrawn ones, and prose it left out, do not. A difference the session would prefer is refused, not asked. **The UI code is the pass's to rewrite — the behavior is not**: queries and mutations, guards, route paths, and every action's outcome stay unchanged, except the work the gate ordered. No unrelated fixes.

## Before the first file moves

**Where no UI exists, no branch**; the pass runs in place.

**Where UI exists, branch first** — its own branch or worktree from a committed base (`design/rework-<date>` or the user's naming), the untracked canvas folder and `.design-audit/` brought along. Dropping the branch reverts everything, at the user's word, closing at Step 9.

- **First act: write `DESIGN.md`** in full and the decision records (`ratify.md`, What is written), then `CLAUDE.md`'s Component library row if the library changed — the only moment any of them is written. **Save the gate block as `.design-audit/gate.md`** — the `DESIGN.md` diff, file plan, ordered work, answered deviations — read on every resume, and the body of the close's commit.
- **Second act: the freshness check.** Re-walk the function inventory against current code; a flow changed since ratification is a new deviation line put to the user **before** its page moves.

**The pass may span sessions, stopping only at a seam point** — after Foundations, after chrome and shared components, after any page. **Nothing is committed on the way**: a session stopping at a seam first writes Step 9's `docs/queue.md` lines for what is left, and the next session resumes from the working tree through Step 0's re-entry gate.

## The fixed order — all canvas pages in one pass, element for element

1. **Foundations.** Where UI exists, first the font install — one line approved in chat — and the detector run (`ratify.md`). Theme files take the new values, old tokens **deleted**, plus everything the canvas CSS carries beyond values: the font loading itself, element rules, shadows, motion durations, and the setup files the canvas relies on (a class-merge registration). Verify in the browser that every declared face and weight loads (`document.fonts`), not only those a page renders — off the browser, through the Proof profile's Visual line, naming what could not be verified. `ratify.md`'s five rules bind.
2. **Chrome and shared components, from the canvas chrome** — in production before any page importing them counts as moved; production logic (auth, navigation, data) is wired into the canvas markup, never the reverse. Placement follows `ui-build`'s placement rule.
3. **Pages — the proving page first**, each canvas file **copied to its real path**, the theme wrapper and canvas-only instruments (proposal tags, canvas nav entries) removed. **Copied means the canvas file becomes the page**; a production page re-tokened from its old markup is not promoted.
   - **Before its data swap, pixel-diff each promoted page on the canvas fixtures against its canvas file** at both widths, with a diff tool run outside the app's dependencies, the diff images kept for Step 8; a differing pixel outside the removed instruments fails the promotion; no tool → `not verified — pixel diff`.
   - **With a data layer**, swap the fixture import for it, per `build-flow` and `logic-settle`, changing only what Step 8's structural diff allows at the data seam, and check each page at both widths: holding → report and continue; first collapse → stop, a rework round of that page. Where `logic-settle` chose the data layer, loading, empty and failed states come from its cache, never a handwritten effect.
   - **With no backend yet**, pages keep fixtures reshaped to `build-flow`'s contract form (`src/contracts/<page>.ts`, `src/contracts/<page>.fixtures.ts`, per its `references/contract.md`), and **each gets a `docs/queue.md` line** `wire <page> to real data`.
4. **Components not on the canvas** — **fix-the-drift only**: retoken to zero raw values; a prop or theme value departing from the library default returns to it unless `DESIGN.md` requires it. **In a redesign this step is empty**; a file here is a failed inventory to report, never to retoken.
5. **`/design-system`** — written here, once (below).
6. **Assets** locked to the old colors — where UI exists: inline SVG, favicon, brand-coloured images.
7. **The old library, engines and font packages are removed**, if their decisions changed.
8. **The lint floor, then `AGENTS.md`'s `## UI` part** (below) — fix-the-drift writes them too.

**Fix the drift** runs here too, on the same isolated branch: the approved findings, nothing else.

## Promotion rules

- **Element for element.** Every visible element survives into the page (fixtures swapped for data, real states added) or appears as a named deviation line at the recap with its reason — real behavior contradicts the drawing · the backend does not exist yet · the control is obsolete. Never substitute a plainer equivalent silently (a bare file input for a drawn dropzone). A canvas control the real flow never had is a canvas error reported for the user's decision, never quietly dropped.
- **The proof is a diff, not a look.** Differences between canvas file and promoted page are confined to the data seam (fixture import swapped, plus loading and error wiring) and approved deviation lines; any other difference is a failed promotion to fix, whichever side reads better.
- **The proving page is the bar** for every later page; with data, its fixtures include `bulk` and `messy` cases. `ui-build` binds every promoted page.
- **Page running → prove it at two widths with screenshots** (`DESIGN.md`'s desktop breakpoint and lowest supported width) per the Proof profile. No capture tooling → say so, name the run target and both widths; never claim they were judged.
- **Survival of real data**, per page at both widths: a layout collapsing under real rows, a token that did not land, or a vanished section stops the pass as a rework round of that page. Real rows differing from fixtures is not divergence.
- **A ratified element whose data does not exist yet** — a gate-ordered migration not yet applied included, since `db-ops` puts the frontend after the run — gets no query: promote it **rendered empty and labelled as waiting**, with one `docs/queue.md` line naming the data. Never dropped or hidden behind a flag.
- **The pass also stops** for a drawn element that would make the app claim what it cannot do — a `build-flow` stop.
- **Detector findings are deferred** to Step 8, overriding `impeccable`'s act-on-findings instruction.
- **Rework rounds.** A page collapsing, or a user-requested rework, gets one. **Two per page at most — a third does not run, and `DESIGN.md` reopens** through the escalation (`canvas.md`, Judging). A changed `DESIGN.md` updates the styling values and rebuilds pages from the new tokens, never patched.

## The `/design-system` route

**Written once, at point 5 — never before the canvas is approved.** An app whose route already sits at `/styleguide` keeps it there, never renamed: every rule naming `/design-system` means that route. It embeds no page — the app itself is the composition.

**One route file** (e.g. `src/pages/design-system.tsx`) at `/design-system` in dev, out of navigation, outside the auth guard, and out of the production build. **It imports the production components and tokens** — never copies, a separate HTML file, or a second source of values. **Render every specimen's actions inert** — a sign-out, write, or send is stubbed through the component's props; a component that cannot take a stub is listed `live only`. Offer deleting it later; never require it.

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| Foundations | Color roles or scales as `DESIGN.md` defines them, with the semantic token list read from the styling files · every text step with a real sample sentence · spacing scale · the density profile table with its numbers, both profiles where a role split produced two · radius, shadow, breakpoints, motion · the contrast section, one row per pair with its computed ratio, in every ratified theme mode. **Rendered by `canvas.md`'s specimen rule** (The foundations board) |
| Components | Every component the app uses or an archetype names — variants, sizes, and states per component, including loading, empty, and failed where they apply, with a short real-usage snippet |
| Archetypes | `DESIGN.md`'s archetype table, one card per archetype on its ratified shell: shell sketch, components, routes |

**Done is measured against the table, not the page looking full**: every semantic token appears; a component checklist written first, never recalled — every component an archetype names with its variants and states (inputs: default, focus, disabled, error; buttons: hover, focus, disabled, loading; stepper, dialog, dropzone rendered open through their own props; a hover or focus state the component's props cannot set is listed `live only`); every archetype card has all three parts. Report **archetype → components it names → where each renders**. The only allowed absence is a component no archetype or flow uses, stated with that reason.

## The lint floor

Write **the four refusals `ui-build` names under its lint floor into the stack's own linter, derived from this app and never pasted from a stock config.**

| Refusal | Derived from |
|---|---|
| Raw element | The shared set the pass promoted, plus what the library ships — only elements this app has a component for |
| Raw value | The utilities and style properties that carry a `DESIGN.md` value — colour, radius, font size, the spacing scale — and the engine props that take one (a chart's `fill`) |
| Numbered ramp step | The ramp names in the styling files. Not written where a legacy adopted-whole Section 5 left no alias layer to read instead |
| Primitive import | The packages the shared set wraps. None → not written |

- **Scoped by path**: the components folder is exempt from the first and fourth, the styling files from the second and third, the `/design-system` route file from the third, `src/design-canvas/` from all four.
- JS/TS web: ESLint's `no-restricted-syntax` and `no-restricted-imports`; other stacks: the analyzer's equivalent **verified live at write time**, an inexpressible refusal reported as `not enforceable on <stack>`. No linter → Step 4 installed one; in fix-the-drift, one install line approved in chat.
- **Proven on what must pass before what must fail.** Lint the promoted app first; a hit on a freshly written page is a raw value to fix or a pattern too wide (`grid-cols-[1fr_auto]`, a `calc()` is not a raw value). Then plant one violation per refusal in a scratch page, see each refused, delete it.
- **Files the pass did not rewrite are baselined, never excused** — in the linter's own suppression baseline, verified live. Never lower a rule to a warning. Report the baseline's size at the close; it only shrinks.
- **One floor, one command**: these four join `logic-settle` Step 7's config (`references/floor.md`) where it exists, or found it. The detector stays alongside.

**Write `AGENTS.md`'s `## UI` part in the same act**, to the shape in `app-settle`'s `references/scaffold.md` (N5): the shared-set file and folder, the library, the styling file, `/design-system`, the lint command (no file → write it whole). A path that does not resolve is a failed item.

Promoted → `verify.md`.
