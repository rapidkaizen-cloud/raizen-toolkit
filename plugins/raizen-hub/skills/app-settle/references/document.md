# Document mode — the documents of an app that never had them

## D1 — Read the stack, do not ask it

Launch the subagent on `repo-read.md`, mode document, and report the STACK block it returns. Everything in it is readable, so none of it is a question.

Rows that come out `not readable` stay that way. They are asked at D3 only where they change what the documents must say — a hosting platform nobody can name does not.

## D2 — The story, then state your reading, then STOP

Run the interview of `SKILL.md`. **The reading may draw on the code, and it must say which parts did**: separate what was measured from what was inferred, so the user knows what they are correcting.

## D3 — Six themes, and one rule that outranks the rest

**Three themes are partly readable and three leave no trace at all.** Roles, rule *values*, and terms came back from D1. Nothing readable is asked as though unknown — it is **shown and confirmed**:

> *"The code caps approvals at 5,000,000 for the `supervisor` role — `rls/approvals.sql:14`. What is that number for?"*

- **The problem before the app, how the work was done then, and the non-goals exist nowhere in the repo**: ask them openly, with no options, in one message where they are independent.
- **The rule that outranks everything else here is the reason behind every number** (`SKILL.md`): the code gave every value and will never give one reason. A recorded ignorance is worth more than a plausible fiction, because the next session knows not to trust it.
- **Confirm the Locale row here, though it was measured**: a half-translated UI measures as whichever half is larger.

## D4 — Summary, then STOP

One message: app name · Surface/Data/Deploy as read · roles · key business rules **with their reasons** · domain terms · non-goals · every row still `not readable`.

## D5 — Write

After the approval, read `prd-structure.md` and `scaffold.md` in one turn. Write `docs/PRD.md` and seed the living documents as `prd-structure.md` states, with two differences:

| Where | Difference from bootstrap mode |
|---|---|
| Stack | Recorded **as found**, each line a measurement naming its file, and no decision record seeded — nobody chose from a list. The Surface row and Proof profile are still written, measured rather than chosen |
| Prohibitions | Only those the user states now. A prohibition inferred from code is not a prohibition, it is a habit |

Then the rows `scaffold.md` marks Both:

- **`CLAUDE.md`** to its shape, filled from D1. Already present → **do not overwrite.** Add only the missing rows and report what was left alone.
- **`AGENTS.md`** to its shape. The `## UI` and `## Logic` parts hold their bootstrap lines — no `DESIGN.md` exists here and no data layer folder has been named; `design-settle` and `logic-settle` each fill their own part. Already present → **do not overwrite**; add the parts it lacks under their own headings and report what was left alone.
- **`README.md` at the root** — already present → **do not overwrite**; report it untouched.
- **A file already at a path this mode writes under `docs/`** → do not overwrite it; report it and ask where it goes before writing.
- **`.claude/settings.json`** enabling `raizen-norms`. Already present with other plugins → add the key, keep the rest.
- **`supabase/config.toml`** only when the database is Supabase Cloud **and** the file is missing; self-hosted follows `scaffold.md`'s The database connection. Present already → leave it alone.

**No scaffold, no `git init` on an existing repo, no host config, no CI workflow** — they already exist or the user decided against them.

`git add` the new files. **Stop before committing.**

## The stack is not on trial — in this mode

**Document mode reports; it does not migrate, and it does not re-litigate.** Say a finding once, in the close block, one line each, and only where it is concrete:

| A finding | Not a finding |
|---|---|
| The library is unmaintained, or has had a supply-chain event | The rubric would have recommended something else |
| A version is past end-of-life for security fixes | A newer framework exists |
| **A norm can never apply here** — a database with no row-level security makes the `db-ops` role test meaningless | You would have picked differently |

- **Never report the right-hand column.** The rubric filters options for a **new** repo, where choosing costs nothing; this repo already paid, and *Not ready* there means no path is written for it, not that it is wrong.
- **Never soften the third row.** It says a guarantee this toolkit makes does not hold in this repo, and the user is entitled to know which one and why.
- **The trial the user wants is rework mode**, in a later session, once these documents exist to judge any change against.

## D6 — Close

One block:

```
Written    : docs/PRD.md · docs/README.md · product.md · rules.md · glossary.md
             README.md [new / untouched] · CLAUDE.md [new / N rows added]
             AGENTS.md [new / N parts added] · .claude/settings.json
Not read   : [rows still unreadable]
Unverified : [what carries [needs verification]]
Findings   : [concrete stack findings only — or "none"]
DESIGN.md  : absent — design-settle writes it
```

Then the next sessions, in this order:

```
/logic-settle   — the logic layer as it stands: what is installed, what is
                  missing, what is the wrong tool. Keeping everything is a
                  valid ending.
/design-settle  — audits the styling, then puts every visual decision to you:
                  ratify what the code already does, or decide otherwise.
/app-settle     — again, once these documents exist: rework mode re-opens business
                  rules, scope, or stack when the app itself must change.
/app-align    — only where the Findings row above is not "none": it changes
                  the existing code to match the rules, one commit per finding.
Until DESIGN.md exists, any session will refuse to write a UI component.
```

`logic-settle` runs first because the promoted pages carry loading, empty, and failed states, and those belong to the data layer.

Do not run any of them now. Close by reminding the user that the first commit waits for their word, and that `raizen-norms` becomes active only once the next session starts in this repo.
