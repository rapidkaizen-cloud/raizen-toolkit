"""Block destructive SQL sent bare.

What is enforced here is SHAPE, not permission. A hook cannot ask, so it does not
know whether the user agreed. What it checks: whether the destructive operation
arrives wrapped in a DO block with RAISE EXCEPTION as its guard, per statement —
one destructive statement without a guard of its own is still blocked even when
another statement in the same payload is guarded.

A guard can only be written once the Expected number exists, and the Expected
number is only born from a gate the user answered. So enforcing the shape is
enough to enforce that the gate happened.

One carve-out: a DELETE narrowed to the `[CLAUDE]` prefix — the test rows the
agent created itself — passes unguarded, because its blast radius is already
fixed to rows the agent owns. See claude_test_delete for what disqualifies it.

One off switch, per repo and never per plugin: a marker file at
`.claude/destructive-gate.off` in the project directory disables this guard for
that repo alone. The file's presence is the decision; its content is free text
naming why. This exists because the plugin's hooks load into every app repo at
once — an app that legitimately needs the gate gone (heavy schema iteration,
bulk re-imports) must not take the gate away from the apps holding production
data. Deleting the marker file turns the gate back on.

Exit 0 = pass, exit 2 = block.
