"""Self-check session_norms.py: the two listings, the two document forms, and that they stay quiet.

Components are found by folder name; the data layer is read from the `Data layer` row
of the app's CLAUDE.md. The quiet cases come first on purpose. Both listings are paid
for in every session of every app repo, so a repo with nothing to list must add
nothing — a listing that appears where it should not costs more than one that is missing.
