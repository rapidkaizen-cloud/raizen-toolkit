"""After a commit that touched no document, ask the session whether one became false.

PostToolUse hook on the shell tools, on Claude Code. On Antigravity a hook that runs
after a tool cannot hand the model text, so `session_norms.py` asks through `unasked`
before the next model call instead. It never blocks. Most commits owe no document, and a
hook cannot tell which do - so it asks, at the one moment the same-commit rule can still
be met by an amend, and takes "none" for an answer.

Silent unless all hold: the project keeps documents (`docs/PRD.md`, or a root `PRD.md`),
the session's own command just ran a `git commit`, HEAD is that commit, and nothing it
changed is a document.
