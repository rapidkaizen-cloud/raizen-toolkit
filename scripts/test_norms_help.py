"""Self-check norms_help.py: the card holds the version, the commands, the pages and one entry.

The last case reads this repo's own docs. `docs/README.md` is the index on GitHub, the
site's sidebar and the card's page list at once, so a page it does not list is in none of
them, and a link it holds to a page that is gone breaks all three. Both fail here.
