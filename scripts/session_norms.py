"""Print the session norms, then the files a session must not start without.

SessionStart hook on Claude Code: stdout is added to the session context. Antigravity
has no such event, so the same script runs as its PreInvocation hook - before every
model call - and hands the same text over once per conversation, as an injected step.

Everything printed here holds in every app repo, so it lives in the plugin rather
than in an app's CLAUDE.md — changing it then reaches every app through a plugin
update instead of an edit in N repositories. An app's CLAUDE.md keeps only what the
plugin cannot know: its stack, its locale, the rules that belong to that app alone,
and the two gates that must survive the plugin being absent.

The documents are injected rather than pointed at. A pointer is obeyed by judgement,
and the sessions that skip it are exactly the narrow ones where its prohibitions still
apply. A repo with a root `PRD.md` is on the legacy form and gets `QUEUE.md` and the
sections of `PRD.md` that `docs/product.md` holds in the other; a repo with `docs/PRD.md`
gets the `docs/` form's block and the three living documents `docs-format` names — never
the frozen ones. A repo with neither gets the `NOT SETTLED` block and its queue, kept at
the root or under `docs/`.

Claude Code replaces a hook's stdout over 10,000 characters with its first 2,000 and a
file path nobody is told to read, which cut the norms off after `LANGUAGE` in every repo
whose documents made the output longer. So the output stays under `BUDGET`: the norms
and the notes always, then each document whole where it fits and named with an order to
read it where it does not, then the listings, cut where the room ends. A pointer that
arrives beats a document that does not.

The two inventories — components, and the data layer's functions — are printed for
the same reason. `ui-build` orders a listing
of the components folder before any element is written, and a skill is loaded by
judgement — a session that never loads it hunts for `Pagination`, misses `Pager`, and
writes it a second time. It is printed here rather than from a PreToolUse hook on
Write because that hook's additionalContext lands beside the tool result: after the
file is already written.

SESSION NORMS (raizen-norms)

These hold in every app repo. The app's CLAUDE.md holds what is true of that app
alone; where the two disagree about a norm, this one is the newer.

"""

LANGUAGE = """\
LANGUAGE
The user's language and the repo's language are two different things. `PRD.md` is
printed or named below in the user's language, and it is the longest thing you will
read this session - do not let it decide the language of what you write.
  The user's language : chat, `PRD.md`, `QUEUE.md`, commit messages, pull
                        requests, and the strings the app puts on screen
  English, always     : comments, identifiers, file names, URL routes, API
                        endpoint paths, and every name in the database - tables,
                        columns, views, enum types, functions, policies, and
                        migration file names
  Decided per case    : enum values. They are stored data rather than a name, so
                        weigh readability against rewriting every existing row,
                        and map them to English keys at the boundary either way.
A route is an identifier the user happens to see - the menu label above it is the
thing written for them. A PRD term that names a thing in the code is translated on
the way in: a PRD that says "view kandidat" becomes `lead_candidates`, never
`lead_kandidat`. Existing code in the other language is a finding to report, not a
licence to match it.

"""

POINTERS = """\
POINTERS - read before touching
  Starting a page, or deciding what to build next : skill `build-flow`
  `PRD.md`                                        : skill `docs-format`
  UI, components, styling tokens                  : skill `ui-build`
  Schema, RLS, migrations                         : skill `db-ops`
  Queries, actions, handlers, keys, env vars      : skill `logic-build`
Skills load by judgement rather than by rule, and a new component triggers no file
read at all - so the components and the data-layer functions this repo already has
are listed at the end of this block, wherever it has any. Do not write new UI without
reading `ui-build` first, do not write a query without reading `logic-build` first,
and do not write a key or an environment variable without its Section 1.

"""

SCOPE = """\
SCOPE
Only what was asked. No refactor, no rename, no "while I'm here" outside scope.
Do not emit documentation that was not explicitly requested. `PRD.md` and `QUEUE.md`
are the only documents maintained in an app repo: `PRD.md` holds intent, `QUEUE.md`
holds what is not built yet.

"""

GIT = """\
GIT
Before anything else: `git fetch`, then check the branch position. Where the repo has a
`development` branch: HEAD on `main` -> stop, and behind `origin/development` -> stop
and ask to run `git pull --ff-only`.

Committing is part of finishing, not a separate request:
  - A scope item that is finished is committed in the same turn, without asking first.
  - Name the paths explicitly. `git add -A` and `git add .` are refused.
  - The message states why, not only what - the diff already shows the what.
  - Paths that changed outside SCOPE are findings reported to the user, never
    committed along.

Do not commit when you stop for one of the three legitimate stops in `build-flow`
Section 6 - the `db-ops` destructive gate, a role test that misses, a business rule
absent from the PRD. Leave the working tree dirty and report the stop instead. So at
the end of a session: a clean tree means finished, a dirty tree means something is
waiting on the user.

`main` never receives a direct commit while `development` exists. A push or a pull
request is a chat stop, never an AskUserQuestion - a dialog gets clicked before it is
read. End the turn on a message with the exact command in backticks on a line of its
own and, under it, every commit it publishes as `- ` bullets: short hash and subject. Run
it only when the reply is a clear yes, in whatever words - a question, a condition or
another instruction is not one. `guard_git` holds the command until that message has a
reply, and one reply covers one run.

"""

ASKING = """\
ASKING
A decision that is the user's is asked through AskUserQuestion, or answered in chat at
a hard stop; then you run it yourself. Never hand the user a command to type - only
what needs their own hands: a browser login, a dashboard, a key rotation, a payment.

"""

DECISIONS = """\
DECISIONS
An answer carrying two or more decisions, options, or recommendations closes with one
table: question - options - recommendation. An answer that only explains, with nothing
for anyone to choose, does not get one; a table where no decision is due only teaches
the reader to skip past every other table.
The recommendation column is never left out, and it names its trade-off. A
recommendation without a trade-off has not finished being thought through - no solution
is free, and where the price has not been found, say that it has not been found.
This comes before the work, while it can still change the plan. The block below is the
report afterwards, and neither replaces the other.

"""

CLOSING = """\
CLOSING THE SESSION
Report per scope item: what changed, or "UNTOUCHED". A scope item that did not change
is flagged. Then this block, always, even where the answer is "none":
  - Which page is usable now, and at which route
  - Which other pages were touched by spread
  - Which defaults you decided yourself
  - Unfinished steps, written as `QUEUE.md` lines rather than as sentences
  - What the user must do by hand
  - Which branch you are on and what you committed
  - PRD: written this session, and what needs the user's decision
A missing block is ambiguous between "none" and "forgot".
