"""Print the help card of this copy of raizen-norms: version, commands, pages, last change.

The `norms-help` skill runs this from the plugin folder it was read from, so the card is
about the copy the session runs: a machine keeps one folder per installed version, and
the newest of them is not always the one a session loaded.

Nothing is written for the card alone. The commands are the `Use` section of `README.md`,
the pages are `docs/README.md`, and the last change is the top entry of `CHANGELOG.md` -
each printed as its file holds it, so the card cannot disagree with them.

Usage: python3 norms_help.py
